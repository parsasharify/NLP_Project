In this project I implemented a Naive Bayes model to classify different kinds of news text by their title.

Naive Bayes is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for classification tasks, such as text classification. It is based on applying Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable. Naive Bayes classifiers are simple, fast, and scalable, but they may not perform well when the independence assumption is violated or when some features are more relevant than others.
